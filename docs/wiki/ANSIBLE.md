# Using ansible to configure OracleDB & ASM

Now that the required infrastructure is allocated on Azure, it is time to install & configure the Oracle DB via ansible.



On the compute source running Ubuntu or on Azure Cloud Shell, follow the steps given below:

1. Switch to the following subdirectory:
```
 $ cd ~/projects/lza-oracle/ansible/bootstrap/single_instance
```

2. Create a new file called inventory:
```
 $ touch inventory
```

3. Edit the file so that it has the following format:

```
[dbservers]

vm-0 ansible_host=<Public IP address of the Azure VM created via terraform>  ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/lza-oracle-single-instance  ansible_user=oracle
```

Below is an example:

4. Start the ansible playbook
```
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory
```
(If you are prompted for "are you sure you want to continue connecting?", enter "yes")

(If using Azure Cloud Shell, remember to refresh your browser by scrolling up or down, every 15 minutes or so since the shell times out after 20 minutes of inaction.)


5. If you get an error stating "ERROR! Invalid callback for stdout specified: community.general.yaml" then run the following step and then re-run the previous step.
```
 $ ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

6. It is acceptable to see warnings highlighted in red.

Once the installation and configuration completes, you will see a screen similar to the one below.

7. Now you can go back to the main [README.md](../../README.md#step-by-step-instructions) file.
