# Intended purpose of this script is to be executed automate the creation of an enterprise application within Entra Id to support Federation between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
# Script must be run under credentials that have been granted the proper rights. The user will require the Application Administrator Role from Entra ID to create an Enterprise Registration, 
# in Entra ID (Azure Active Directory). 

# Please note From Azure AD Group Management requires Entra ID P1 or P2 Licensces. Please refer to the following article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/applicationtemplate-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#code-try-1
